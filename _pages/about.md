Bio
====
I am a Ph.D candidate in Statistics at the University of Chicago, expecting to graduate in Spring 2020. Before starting graduate school, I spent two years in South Korea, one year working at an insurance firm as an actuarial associate and another year teaching SAT and TOEFL to high school students. At the same time, I independently worked on a project at Labor Dynamics Institute at Cornell remotely. For my undergraduate studies, I majored in mathematics and economics and minored in music at Cornell University. 

Research Interests
====
I am interested in applied data analysis and methodology developments. My current research focuses on applications to biology including DNA-seq, RNA-seq. and scRNA-seq. Data sets in biology pose difficult statistical challenges because they are often high dimensional, intricately correlated, and incomplete. My role as a statistician is to develop methods to learn as much meaningful information from these data sets. My methods range from Bayesian variable selection to network analysis and similarity learning.
