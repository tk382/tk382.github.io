I am a Ph.D candidate in Statistics and am advised by [Dan Nicolae](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~nicolae/) and [Mengjie Chen](http://www.mengjiechen.com/). I work on applied data analysis and methodology developments. My current research focuses on applications to biology including DNA-seq, RNA-seq. and scRNA-seq. Data sets in biology pose difficult statistical challenges because they are often high dimensional, intricately correlated, and incomplete. My role as a statistician is to develop methods to learn as much meaningful information from these data sets. My methods range from Bayesian variable selection to network analysis and similarity learning. I am also interested in the application of machine learning and predictive modeling in genomics.

Before starting graduate school, I spent two years in South Korea, one year working at an insurance firm as an actuarial associate and another year teaching math to high school students. I also remotely worked on a large data wrangling project at Labor Dynamics Institute at Cornell. For my undergraduate studies, I double-majored in mathematics and economics and minored in music at Cornell University. Outside work, I love to sing, dance, read, and practice guitar and piano. I currently sing as a part of Rockefeller Chapel Choir. Recently, I earned a certificate to teach ZumbaÂ®!
