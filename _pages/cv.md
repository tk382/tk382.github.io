Research <a name="res"></a>
======
* Multi-tissue Gene Expression Analysis, advised by Dan Nicolae
  * employ Bayesian hierarchical model with EM algorithm and MCMC that circumvents missing value issues and accounts for complex variance structure
  * working paper: [Multivariate Bayesian Analysis with Incomplete Data: Application to Local Ancestry Effects on admixed Transcriptome](https://github.com/tk382/localAnc/blob/master/later_edit.pdf)
* Noisy Data Clustering, advised by Mengjie Chen
  * design a similarity learning algorithm to cluster zero-inflated data with high noise and apply to single-cell sequencing data
  * R package and Tutorial: [SCNoisyClustering](https://tk382.github.io/SCNoisyClustering/index.html)
* Copy Number Variation Change Point Analysis, advised by Mengjie Chen
  * devise an alternating descent algorithm combining group fused lasso and mixed effects model to detect copy number alterations in cancer cells
  * R package: [CopyNumberCellShift](https://github.com/tk382/CopyNumberCellShift/blob/master/analysis/writeup/paper/paper.pdf)
* Ancestry-eGenes, advised by Dan Nicolae
  * found genes that are differentially expressed based on local ancestry and genotypes for 44 human tissues in African Americans and European Americans; found an enrichment in the immunity-related region
* Microbiome Data Analysis, consulting team leader
  * Advised a manuscript revision in a medical journal for sound analysis of microbiome data, especially to model within and between group variance accounting for complex batch effects [[link]](https://peerj.com/articles/5166/?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_campaign=PeerJ_TrendMD_1&utm_medium=TrendMD)
* Effects of Maternal Language Use in Children’s Brain Development, consulting team leader
  * Led a consulting team to provide statistical analysis for complex correlated data for a psychologist’s post-doctoral project
* Computing Variance across Large Data Sets, advised by Lars Vilhuber
  * Manually implemented map-reduce for 3.3TB census data with several million time-series while avoiding memory issue and ensuring numerical stability
