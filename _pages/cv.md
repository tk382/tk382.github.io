Research
======
* Multi-tissue Gene Expression Analysis, advised by Dan Nicolae
  * employ Bayesian hierarchical model with EM algorithm and MCMC that circumvents missing value issues and accounts for complex variance structure
* Noisy Data Clustering, advised by Mengjie Chen
  * design a similarity learning algorithm to cluster zero-inflated data with high noise and
apply to single-cell sequencing data
