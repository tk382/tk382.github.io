Education <a name="edu"></a>
======
* Ph.D. in Statistics, University of Chicago, 2020 (expected)
* M.S. in Statistics, University of Chicago, 2017
* B.A. in Mathematics and Economics (Music Minor), Cornell University, 2013

Awards <a name="awa"></a>
======
* Davis Wallace Award for Applied Statistics, 2018
* Scholarship for Summer Institutes at the University of Washington in Seattle, 2017


Research <a name="res"></a>
======
* Multi-tissue Gene Expression Analysis, advised by Dan Nicolae
  * employ Bayesian hierarchical model with EM algorithm and MCMC that circumvents missing value issues and accounts for complex variance structure
* Noisy Data Clustering, advised by Mengjie Chen
  * design a similarity learning algorithm to cluster zero-inflated data with high noise and
apply to single-cell sequencing data
* Copy Number Variation Change Point Analysis, advised by Mengjie Chen
  * devise an alternating descent algorithm combining group fused lasso and mixed effects model to detect copy number alterations in cancer cells
* Ancestry-eGenes, advised by Dan Nicolae
  * found genes that are differentially expressed based on local ancestry and genotypes for 44 human tissues in African Americans and European Americans; found an enrichment in the immunity-related region
* Microbiome Data Analysis, consulting team leader
  * Advised a manuscript revision in a medical journal for sound analysis of microbiome data, especially to model within and between group variance accounting for complex batch effects
* Effects of Maternal Language Use in Children’s Brain Development, consulting team leader
  * Led a consulting team to provide statistical analysis for complex correlated data for a psychologist’s post-doctoral project
* Computing Variance across Large Data Sets, advised by Lars Vilhuber
  * Manually implemented map-reduce for 3.3TB census data with several million time-series while avoiding memory issue and ensuring numerical stability
